# Unity Physics-Based Rendering Optimization

This Unity project focuses on optimizing the performance of scenes that utilize Physics-Based Rendering (PBR). By employing various techniques and best practices, this project aims to enhance the rendering efficiency and overall performance of PBR-based scenes in Unity.

## Features

- **Performance analysis and profiling**: The project provides tools for analyzing and profiling the performance of PBR scenes. It enables users to identify performance bottlenecks, such as high GPU or CPU usage, and provides insights into optimizing scene rendering.

- **Material and shader optimization**: The project explores techniques to optimize materials and shaders used in PBR scenes. It covers topics such as reducing shader complexity, optimizing texture usage, and leveraging Unity's shader features for improved performance.

- **Lighting optimization**: The project focuses on optimizing lighting setups to achieve better performance in PBR scenes. It covers techniques such as light baking, lightmap optimizations, and light culling strategies to reduce the rendering cost of dynamic and static lights.

- **Geometry optimization**: This project addresses techniques for optimizing the geometry of PBR scenes. It includes methods to reduce the polygon count, optimize mesh colliders, and utilize LOD (Level of Detail) systems for efficient rendering.

- **Texture and asset optimization**: The project explores strategies to optimize textures and assets used in PBR scenes. It covers topics such as texture compression, texture atlasing, and asset streaming to minimize memory usage and loading times.

- **Batching and draw call optimization**: The project focuses on techniques to optimize batching and draw calls in PBR scenes. It covers Unity's static and dynamic batching, GPU instancing, and other methods to reduce the number of draw calls and improve rendering performance.
